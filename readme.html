<h1>Local Development Setup Instructions</h1>

<hr />

This is a work in progress. Please read carefully.
<h2>Let's get straight to it:</h2>
<h3>1. Install Virtual Box:</h3>
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a>
<h3>2. Install Vagrant:</h3>
<a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html</a>
<h3>3. Create some directories</h3>
Make two a new directories on your machine, wherever you like. Read below for more info on what they are for. I have mine in /Users/raykamille/
<pre>local_development/</pre>
<pre>local_development/virtual-web-sites/</pre>
<strong>local_development/</strong> is where you will clone the git repo for the virtual web server.

<strong>local_development/virtual-web-sites/</strong> is where you will clone git repo's for the various sites

So put them some place accordingly.
<h3>4. Clone this git repo</h3>
into local_development/

#put the git repo here
<h3>5. Let's launch the new enviornment</h3>
Command line for now as this is version .01
<pre>cd /path/to/local_development/vagrant/</pre>
<pre>vagrant up</pre>
<h3>6. While it's doing it's thing, add this to your 'hosts' file.</h3>
<pre># Local Development Hosts
192.168.77.10 localhost.default
</pre>
<h3>7. Wait for it to finish, the first run can take a little bit</h3>
<h3>8. Once it's done... you should be able to click this link and see a default wordpress install</h3>
<a href="http://localhost.default/" target="_blank">http://localhost.default/</a>

<h3><strong>Some notes for reference:</strong></h3>
Vagrant is a wrapper for Virtual Box
<br/><br/>
Virtual Box is virtual machine software -vagrant is using it to a virtual machine on your computer
<br/><br/>
The virutal machine is running linux - debian squeeze to be more specific
<br/><br/>
The virtual machine is running a web server at 192.168.77.10
<br/><br/>
The virtual machine has a shared folder with your machine
localdevelopment/virtual-web-sites/
<br/><br/>
localhost.default is served from here:
<br/><br/>
localdevelopment/virtual-web-sites/default/webroot
<br/><br/>
